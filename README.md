# Foreground-Detection 
============

Foreground-Detection Algorithms was developed by Yu-Shiang Yan.<br>
it was designed on vision surveillance system<br>
the algorithms was assembled by three major parts:
<ul>
  <li>Tranditional method</li>
  
  <li>Adaptive method</li>
  
  <li>GMM method</li>

</ul> 
<br>
following are the quick start steps:
<ol>
  <li>build libVision.so </li>
  <li>build UnitestVision</li>
  <li>execute UnitestVision</li>
  <li>now you are good to go!</li>
</ol>
